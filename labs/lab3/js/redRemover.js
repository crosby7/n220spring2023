/* To complete this function, I'll create a redRemover(x, y, z) function. Within this function, I'll set x to zero, and return vector x,y,z.

In draw(), I'll declare a var noRed. I'll call this function with the example color, and set noRed equal to the returned vector. After, I'll set fill to noRed. Then just draw a circle().
