/* To complete this function, I'll create a function drawCar() that draws two circles over a rectangle - a rudimentary car graphic. Since these need to be drawn in distinct positions relative to the entire car, I'll use variables x and y in drawCar(x, y) and have the circles offset from the rect().

I'll place this function in draw() and have x and y in drawCar(x, y) be mouseX and mouseY
