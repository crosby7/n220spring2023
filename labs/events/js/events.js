/* Color Changer

To complete this, I'll create 
three square divs (styled in a style tag in the head -- 200px by 200px and floated left, 5px margin, grey)
hen using one event handler, I'll listen for a click on the divs. Inside the handler, 
each element will change colors based on their data-color attribute (red, green, blue)


*/

/* Color Mixer

First, I'll create a wide div that will start with black color. Then, I'll create a div
that will have innerHTML: "current color: rgb(" + the accessed color of the div + ")".
Then, 9 buttons will be used to change the color using an onclick event handler. 
Each button will have a data-color attribute and a data-strength attribute (i.e. "red" and "1")
The event handler will use if/else if to change the color of the large div. The
innerHTML of the display div will be updated here.

*/

/* Flash Cards

I'll create three buttons in HTML that ask questions. Each will have a data-answer.
An event handler will change the innerHTML of an answerDiv to the data-answer.
