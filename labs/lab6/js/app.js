/* Loop but big
For this, I'll create a for loop, looping between i = 0 and i < 5. Then, I'll use createElement('div') to display (i + 1) * 1000 to the div


*/

/* Beep Bop

I'll start with another for loop, iterating between i = 0 and i < 25. 
Then, I'll create a series of if/elseif statements. If (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0), I'll display "beepbop" to a created div. Start with this one because it will be skipped if the other two tests are true instead. 

Then, if (i % 3 == 0), I'll display "beep"

If (i % 5 == 0 ), then I'll display "bop"

If none of them return true, just display the iterand i. 



*/

/* Runner Up

I'll start by declaring and defining an array of 3 runners' best times, in order from lowest to highest.


Then, a short for loop, i = 0 to i < 3, will display the indexed times to a created div each iteration. 


*/

/* Favorray

I'll start by making a string array of 5 of my favorite things. Then, I'll loop through the array, creating a div that displays the indexed string followed by a predefined string " is one of my favorite things"
