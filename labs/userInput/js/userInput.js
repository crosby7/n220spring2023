/* Greeter

To complete this, I will create a text input and a button in HTML. Then, I'll get a reference to the input so I can track its value. 
Then, in an onclick function call on the button, I'll print "Hello " followed by the value of the input to the console.
 

*/

/* Tip Calc

To do this, I'll first make a numeric input and a button in HTML. 
Then I'll get a reference to the input in JS. 
An onclick function call on the button will take the value of the input as a bill total,
then calculate a 20% tip and store that as a separate local variable. 
Then, a print to console will display "Tip: " and the tip amount, "Total: " and the bill + tip.

*/

/* Password Protected

I'll make two text inputs and one submit button.

Onclick (on the button), a function will be called that will check the two fields. 
If the first field says "username" AND the second says "password", then a div on the page
will be updated to say "Success". If the fields are incorrect, the div will say "Wrong information"
