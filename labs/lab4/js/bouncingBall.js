/* Create a circle that moves down and left 5px per update. 
Store speed as var
World bounds = canvas
When the ball reaches the edge, mult appropriate speed by -1
L/R bounds - x speed
Top/Bottom Bounds - y speed


For this assignment, I'll create an object someBall with stored values for size, color, and velocity. 

Then, I'll create a draw() function that will draw the ball, moving by its saved velocity until it reaches a boundary. On reaching a boundary, the appropriate speed will be multiplied by -1.
