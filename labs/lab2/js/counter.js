/* In this exercise, I need to print a number to the console every draw call. This number should start at 0 and increment by one every frame. 

To do this, I will need a variable that has this number. 
To output to the console, I use console.log(). I can put the variable in here to print the value of the variable. 
After, and only after, printing the value, I can then increment the variable by 1.
