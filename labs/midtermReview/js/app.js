/* UI Navigation Highlighter

To make this application, I'll create 7 divs in the HTML file. The first is a holder for all the text of the 6 other clicked divs. 
#id navCollection

The other 6 can be clicked to highlight them - change background color and highlight text
When highlighted, the other previously highlighted divs are un-highlighted.

Then, the navCollection div will add the clicked div's text to its innerHTML

To do this, I'll create a function that takes an element as a parameter. This function will be
called on click in HTML by each of the 6 divs. 
The function will first set all divs of the class uiNav (the 6 divs) to basic style (no background color, no bold text)

Then the function will take the element given as a parameter and "highlight it". Finally, it will add the text
of the clicked div to the navCollection
